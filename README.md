# Stepstone
A simple chrome extension that helps your brain speed-read by bolding the first half of every word on the page.

Just an interesting little evening project really.

# Installation
This isn't available in the extensions store currently, but if you wanted to try it:
- Clone or download the repo
- Go to chrome://extensions/ or brave://extensions/ in your browser
- Enable Developer Mode on that page
- Click the Load Unpacked button and browse to the repo directory
- You should now see it in your extensions list

# Usage
Browse to any page with paragraphs of text (i.e. <p> tags in the html), and then just click the extension icon. The first half of every word of those paragraphs should be bolded.

In theory, this helps your brain pattern match on words and improves retention when speed reading. I hope to use this extension to actually test that theory. :)
